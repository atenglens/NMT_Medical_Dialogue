Em, well, letâ€™s just go back to the breathlessness. Umâ€¦ that could mean different things to different people. Can you explain exactly what you mean when you say breathlessness?
Okay, so youâ€™re saying, erm, it seems to be getting worse when youâ€™re moving, or, walking around?
Anything else that you notice that makes it worse? Okay, in particular, does lying flat make it worse?
And, have you ever experienced waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for breath?
And if you donâ€™t mind me asking, how many pillows do you normally sleep with at night?
And you said this started about a week ago. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
Okay, thatâ€™s good to hear. Um, and over the last week, how would you say itâ€™s changed at all?
Seems to be getting worse.. okay. And, in what way is it getting worse?
So, now itâ€™s just, um, getting worse by itâ€™s becoming more common throughout the day.
So, Iâ€™ve asked you quite a few questions now. And, I just want to find out from yourself, um, is there anything that you think might be going on?
And, as we mentioned before, the, you know, the best thing to do is, uh, what weâ€™re doing right now, and youâ€™ve done the best thing by coming in today.
Just want to move on to asking you a bit about how your health has been leading up to today.
Um, so, in the last few weeks or months, um, have you noticed any weight loss?
Have you noticed any sweating, particularly at night? Have you had a fever at all? Felt quite warm, okay. And when did you first notice that?
Okay, so about a week ago as well. Have you taken anything to try to help with the fever? Did it help at all?
Hi, my name is Dr. Chung. I'm one of the doctors working in the emergency department. What brings you in today?
Can you tell me a little bit about your chest pain? When did it start? Does it radiate anywhere? Does it stay in the middle of your chest? Or does it move to your left shoulder or your jaw? Does anything make it better or worse? If you had to rate the pain from one to ten, how would you rate your pain? And is the pain always there or does it kind of come and go?
Are there any other symptoms that are bothering you today including shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, fevers, cough, or dark stools?
Now, when you tell me you have dizziness, are you talking about feeling like the room is spinning or do you feel like you are going to pass out or lose consciousness?
Do you have any medical problems or any medical conditions where you take medicines regularly? And if so, what medications are you taking?
Do you have any allergies to any medications that you've taken in the past? And if so, what was the reaction that you had to them? Have you ever used any drugs? And if so, which kinds? Do you drink alcohol regularly? And if so, how much do you drink in a week?
Can you tell me a little bit more about your abdominal pain? Can you point to where it hurts the most? Are you having any nausea or vomiting with this abdominal pain? When was the last time you had a bowel movement and what color was your bowel? Was there any blood with your bowel movement?
I know you said your bowel movement was dark, but could you describe how it looked like to you? Was it dark and tarry? Was it black colored or was it just dark brown? Was there any blood in the stool that you could see? Was the blood bright red?
Have you ever had an endoscopy done to evaluate your ulcers? Have you ever had a colonoscopy? And if so, when was the last time you had a colonoscopy? And what did they find?
Hey, can you tell me your name? Can you tell me your full name? Do you know where you are right now? Can you tell me what kind of place you're in right now? Can you tell me what year it is? What is the year? Can you wiggle your toes? Can you wiggle your fingers? Squeeze my hands.
I know it's really chaotic right now, but my name is Eric. I'm one of the doctors working on the trauma team. A lot of things are gonna happen all at once. We're going to take off all your clothes to see if there's any injuries on your body and we're going to press on places to see if there's any pain. If you have any pain, can you please tell me when I press on it? Is there anything bothering you right now? Can you tell me if you're having any chest pain or shortness of breath?
Can you take your finger and touch my finger and then after you touch my finger with your finger can you touch your nose and continue to repeat this as I move my finger. Could you take your heel of your foot and run it down the shin of your other leg and could you also do that with your other leg.
Do you live by yourself? Do you live with anybody who can help you when you're at home? Do you have anybody that can pick you up right now?
Have you ever had a history of having a clot in your leg or in your lungs? Have you ever had a history of having cancer in the recent six months? Do you use any oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy? Are any of your legs more swollen than the other? Have you ever coughed up blood?
Can you give me a big smile? Can you take a look at your face and tell me if this looks the same as your smile before or if one side looks like it's drooping more than the other?
Can you feel me touching you on the sides of your face? Do both sides feel the same? Can you feel me touching you up here in your arms? Do they feel the same? Can you feel me touching you in the legs? Does it feel the same? Can you feel me touching you?
When you say you have numbness, are you talking about not being able to feel anything or does it feel like pins and needles in your hands and in your feet? Does it feel like your foot has fallen asleep or does it completely feel like there's no sensation there?
So your lab results have resulted and everything looks somewhat okay. The only thing is with your risk factors and the story that you are telling me, we are a little concerned that this could possibly be a heart-related issue that is not being picked up by the lab results. And because of that, we feel that it probably would be safer if you were to be admitted to the hospital to be seen by a cardiologist and to be observed overnight just to make sure that this chest pain doesn't come back.
So your CT scan has resulted and it shows that you have inflammation in your gallbladder, meaning that you may potentially need surgery. We called our surgery team and they will come downstairs soon to talk to you about your results and determine the need for surgery.
So your CT results have come back and one thing that it picked up is that there is a mass in your lungs that would explain why you're having the symptoms that you are having. With where it is and what it looks like we are concerned that this could potentially be cancerous, but we do not know for certain what exactly this mass is, we would need to get a biopsy of the mass to confirm or disprove whether or not this is cancerous or not. What's important now is that you follow up with an oncologist who would be able to take a biopsy of the mass and tell you exactly what that mass is.
So on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain of your life, how bad would you say your pain is?
When did this all start? And what were you doing when it all started?
Is the cough productive? And if so, what color is the sputum?
Have you had any fevers recently? Any chills or night sweats?
Have you ever been told you have lung or heart disease?
Does anybody in your family have cancer that you know of?
Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night feeling short of breath?
How many inhalers would you say you've used in the past six months?
Do you smoke? How many packs per day? Have you ever thought about quitting?
Have you started any new medications in the past few weeks?
So based on what you've told me, it sounds like this could be caused by a problem with your heart. And given that, I'd like to get a picture of your heart called an echocardiogram to test this out.
Looking at your chest x-ray, it seems that you have what's called a pneumonia. Have you ever heard of this before?
So we're going to send you home with some antibiotics that should help you feel better. You should follow up with your primary care provider in a week or so to make sure that this treatment worked.
How far can you walk before you feel a sort of breath?
Do you have any chest pain? Nausea? Do you feel sweaty at all?
Do you ever have trouble breathing when you're lying flat? Well, how many pillows would you say that you use to sleep at night?
Are there any positions that make your breathing better? Any positions that make it worse?
Have you had any recent illnesses? Have you traveled anywhere recently?
When we looked at your labs, we saw that you're a bit anemic, meaning that the cells in your blood that carry oxygen aren't functioning the way they should. This may explain why you've been feeling short of breath.
Is it okay if I listen to your heart and lungs?
Have you had seizures?
Are you taking any medications for it?
What were you taking and why did you stop?
I have a note here that you went to the ER on April, were you having seizures before then?
How many seizures have you had since April?
I see here that you had a seizure in June and they increased your Keppra to 1 gram 2 times a day.
Two pills two times a day. Have you ever missed a dose?
Was this before or after the dose increase?
Was this before or after the dose increase?
You have had no seizures after the medication increase?
Since April, you had four seizures in total?
Do you have past medical conditions?
Are you taking any other medication?
Do you have a family history of seizures?
So your sister as well, I'm going to examine you.
Okay, your electroencephalogram shows that you have seizure disorder. This was done on May before your medication increased and we have to talk about getting you another test. The MRI of your head was normal and all of your labs are fine. It's very important that you do not miss a dose.
Well, it's actually too early for DMV paperwork. You have to have six months without a seizure to even consider that. Let's do a quick examination. Look straight ahead and follow the pen with your eyes. Push your neck against my hand and don't let me push to the side. Put your shoulder and arms like this. Okay? Look up. Excellent. Have you had any problems walking or loss of strength in extremities?
Does the pain run down your leg?
Have you lifted anything heavy?
It sounds like regular muscle strain. I can only recommend you massage and apply a hot pack to the muscle.
So I'm just going to find out a little bit about the problem that you've come in with. Would that be alright?
Just in your own words, tell me what's brought you in today.
So before two or three weeks no problems really.
Can you check? Do you have any blood in it at all?
And do you ever see any food that's not digested properly in it?
So you said diarrhea, but how many times a day does it actually happen?
And do you have any tummy pain at all?
Then does that pain go away once you've been to the toilet?
I'm just going to ask the rest of the questions just about the whole gut itself.
Do you have any difficulty chewing your food at all?
No mouth ulcers or anything like that?
Do you ever get indigestion?
And prior to that, what was your bowel habit like?
So just want to ask you some questions about the other systems of the body.
So do you get any headaches, fits, faints, blackouts, anything like that?
Any problems with breathing?
Do you ever feel your heart having extra beat?
Any difficulty breathing at night?
Okay, you've told me quite a bit about your tummy. So any muscle aches and pains at all?
So just a final check on your symptoms. So you've told me there's a little bit of blood in the diarrhea.
