[word_alignments] contains word alignment pairs and the symmetrized alignment outputs from [fast_align](https://github.com/clab/fast_align). The alignments are between the original CSMS validation Chinese source sentences and the CSMS English target sentences, translation of CSMS by our best [OPUS<sub>zh-en</sub>](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en) model, and translation of CSMS by ChatGPT.
